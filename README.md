# Shotbow's ToggleSneak Mod

## About
### Motivation
Since Minecraft 1.15, 'Toggle' sneaking mode is a built-in option. However, this mod has benefits over the official toggle sneak:
- Supports Toggle and Hold modes simultaneously.
- Does not activate when flying or dismounting from entities; such as horses or when in spectator mode.
- Addition of Toggle Sprint.
- Optional display with the status of both sneak and sprint.

### Controls
By default, both sneak and sprint are enabled.
Sprinting is active when you move.
Sneaking (TOGGLE) can be active by pressing the sneak key once.
Sneaking (HOLD) can be active by holding the sneak key. When you let go, you will unsneak.
